## What is this repo about?
---
In this repository I wanted to bring each project and section into their own directory. This way I can demonstrate what I've learned and show how it can be applied. This is a better solution than copy/pasting from the source code directly. I will be able to demonstrate more advance code and skills than what the course provides.
